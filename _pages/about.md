## Who am I?

My name is Maksym Bondarenko, and I am an international student from Ukraine graduating from the Lawrenceville School in 2022. I am passionate about artificial intelligence and natural language processing, and I plan to major in computer science in college. I have been programming for a little bit more than a year now, and I have found blog posts and tutorials written by other people to be incredibly helful in getting started with artificial intelligence and coding in general. For me, this blog is a way to showcase my work as well as to give back to future generatios of programmers the support I had received when starting up.

## Why AI?

I believe in a couple of years AI will become as ubiquitous as internet is today, and I want to take part in shaping that future. I had grown up on sci-fi books, and I can now see how more and more of the fiction about AI comes true, both positive and negative. I think the best way to mitigate that risk is to make sure more and more people can build and use the technology, taking it out of the realm of improbable and into the mainstream. One thing I love about the field is that it is already very open, with leading companies like Gooogle, Facebook, and Open AI making their technology openly available to everyone. Coming from Ukraine though, I can see that there is still a huge difference in adoption of this techology in different communities, and I hope that by creating consumer products the technology can be normalized everyewhere across the world.

## How did you get into AI?

I initially got into AI through linguistics, when during Internal Linguistics Olympiad in 2017 I have attended a lecture about word-embeddings in Dublin University. I really did not understand much back then, but the idea of simulating human language excited me, and after I took a 3-year long break to do physics, I have came back eager to learn more. Little did I know that by that time whatever I heard in the lecture in 2017 was incredibly outdated, and so I had to learn everything from scratch. But this is something I like about AI - it's a constantly changing field, where anything is fluid and the state-of-the-art can be broken any day.

## Anything else?

Besides from my AI/NLP passion, I also love swimming, chess and theater. Also, here is my [resume](../files/resume.pdf), if you are interested.
