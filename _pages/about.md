### Who am I?
My name is Maksym Bondarenko, and I am an international student from Ukraine graduating from the Lawrenceville School in 2022. I am passionate about artificial intelligence and natural language processing, and I plan to major in computer science in college. I have been programming for a little bit more than a year now, and I have found blog posts and tutorials written by other people to be incredibly helful in getting started with artificial intelligence and coding in general. For me, this blog is a way to showcase my work as well as to give back to future generatios of programmers the support I had received when starting up.

### How did you get into AI?
I initially got into AI through linguistics, when during Internal Linguistics Olympiad in 2017 I have attended a lecture about word-embeddings in Dublin University. I really did not understand much back then, but the idea of simulating human language excited me, and after I took a 3-year long break to do physics, I have came back eager to learn more. Little did I know that by that time whatever I heard in the lecture in 2017 was incredibly outdated, and so I had to learn everything from scratch. But this is something I like about AI - it's a constantly changing field, where anything is fluid and the state-of-the-art can be broken any day.

### Anything else?
Besides from my AI/NLP passion, I also love swimming, chess and theater. Also, here is my [resume](../files/resume.pdf), if you are interested.
